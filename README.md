Duties 2.0 for the new Minecraft API (Workbench)
================================================

Duties provides an escape route for admins and mods (these who do have the permission), which lets them save all their survival stuff and later be able to revert back to it. For example, you are adventuring in a cave, and someone tells you that someone has griefed his house. Just type /dutymode and go investigate it. When you're done, just type /dutymode again, and you are back with all your stuff you had before. 

The planned release time is around halloween, after Minecraft 1.4 has been released. Until then I will keep updating Duties 1.x (http://bit.ly/Nqadlg) in case there's a reported bug or something breaks. 

Please keep in mind that the project is far from done, and there are still major decisions left to make regarding how everything should work. Therefore, it's still too early to draw any conclusion about the project.

Changes
--------
* Rewritten for Workbench, the new Minecraft API
* Safe survival state saving to files (this means no more data lost on server crashes).
* Possibly a new survival player simulator, meaning that it could spawn a npc of you where you were off-duty
* Integrated profile management (previously known as Duties-Groups)
* Integrated statistics management (previously known as Duties-Stats), might add MySQL and/or SQLite support to that
* ...
